# Epidemic Simulator

Welcome to Epidemic Simulator. This program simulates the spread of a fake disease through a population. 

<h2> Description </h2>

The simulation starts with one infected ball within a large population. Balls float around the screen
and if they touch infected balls have a chance to pass on the disease to healthy balls. The user can select how contagious the infection is, how long the infection lasts, and the fatality rate. They can also select how large the starting population is, and what percentage of the population chooses to quarantine.

Once started, a typical simulation will look something like this...

<h2> Technology Used and Remarks</h2>

Epidemic Simulator is written in Python 3 and uses the PyGame library. You can visit the PyGame Github page here: <a href="https://github.com/pygame" target="_top">github.com/pygame</a>.

Epidemic Simulator is largely inspired by the Washington Post article <i>Why outbreaks like coronavirus spread exponentially, and how to “flatten the curve”</i>. To read the article click <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/" target="_top">here</a>. 

Some code used in Epidemic Simulator is derivative of work done by Greg Winther. His code to generate the live updating graph was especially useful. To view Greg's work you can visit his Github page: <a href="https://github.com/gregwinther" target="_top">github.com/gregwinther</a>.
